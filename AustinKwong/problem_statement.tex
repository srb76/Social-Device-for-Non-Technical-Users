\section*{Abstract}
For this project, we will be working on an application for a dedicated social device. This device will connect a userâ€™s friends and family. Our job is to improve the dedicated application for maximum performance. We will be measuring and improving transitions, data loading, caching, storage, and some other considerations. Overall, there will be an improvement in user experience, app performance and an increase of features provided by the application.

\section*{Problem Definition}
The project relates to a simplified social device. The device uses Android as its underlying operating system and runs a dedicated app. The app is the only way to interact with the device and connects users to their friends and family. This team of students will help to optimize the dedicated app (Cordova/Android) for maximum performance. This includes transitions, data loading, caching, storage, and any other considerations. Our main objectives will be to improve processing speed, make the application UI and features more intuitive, as well as implement some new features.
\section*{\newline Proposed Solution}
Before meeting with our client, our preliminary thoughts are to benchmark the current application through some sort of pummel test to quantify transfer speeds for messages, and some other time measurable processes by stress testing with a large number of messages, size of messages, or frequency of messages. We will also implement a few features given from our client that are fully drawn out. How should we implement the feature, what are the feature requirements, how will we know when the feature is done as well as some tests for the features. Lastly we will be hopefully working with he client directly to figure out and understand how the client wants the application to look as well as what features are most important to its users.
\section*{\newline Performance Metrics}
We hope to be able to quantify transitions/transfers, data loading, caching, and storage by timing them and stress testing them with large data sets or number of transitions. This is the only quantifiable data at this time.
